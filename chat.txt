Topics: Home Capabilities section redesign - three-column layout with parallax effects
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, restructured Capabilities section from 2-column to 3-column grid (image left, moving text center, accordion right). Added parallax scroll effects: left image zooms in only (scale 1 to 1.2) without translation using only scale transform, center text scrolls vertically (300px down) and fades (opacity 1 to 0.2) as it exits, right accordion list remains static. Implemented scroll-based transform calculations using `capabilitiesRef`, scroll progress detection, and state management for imageScale, textTransform, and textOpacity. Fixed text animation to use `translateY` instead of `translateX` for correct vertical movement. Reduced main heading font size from 48px to 36px. Updated parallax logic to trigger only when section is fully in viewport (section top < 0 && bottom > 0), with progress calculated as absolute top / height. Moved descriptive text below image outside animated wrapper so it remains static.
Decisions: Page-scoped parallax logic; 3 equal columns with 64px gaps; image and text move at different speeds based on scroll progress through section (minHeight 90vh, section padding 100px).
Next steps: Verify parallax smoothness and responsiveness across breakpoints; test accordion interactions with new layout.

Topics: Contact section text fill-back animation with floating 3D icons
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, replaced Contact section with new layout featuring large promotional text and floating 3D app icons (Photoshop, ChatGPT, monkey icon, S logo). Added text fill-back animation where text transitions from gray (#999) to black (#000) letter-by-letter across all rows based on scroll progress. Implemented scroll-based animation using `contactRef`, linear progress calculation (scrolled / scrollDistance where scrollDistance = viewport height + section height), and `textFillProgress` state. Created `renderAnimatedText()` helper function that combines all text lines into single string, calculates filledLetters count based on global progress, maps over textLines to render each letter with globalIndex calculation, and renders conditional `<br />` between lines. Icons positioned absolutely with perspective 3D transforms and semi-transparent styling. Letter-by-letter animation across all rows provides progressive reveal effect.
Decisions: Animation triggers when section is in viewport; text fills progressively from left to right, top to bottom as section scrolls through viewport; floating icons provide visual interest without distraction.
Next steps: Verify animation smoothness; adjust thresholds if needed; test responsiveness across breakpoints.

Topics: Footer section redesign - dark theme with logo, navigation, and social links
Code changes: In `src/components/FlowAnimation.jsx`, completely redesigned footer section to match provided image. Removed scroll animation logic. Added dark green background (#0a2a1a). Created three-column layout: left side with Vulturelines logo (Vlt_logo1.png) and tagline "Vulturelines" in black (#000) with subtitle "With strategic design and Webflow development." in white, right side with EXPLORA navigation column and CONTACT info column. Bottom section includes social media icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) with hover effects, copyright text, and legal links. All styling done inline with hover states for interactive elements. Updated tagline to "Vulturelines" with smaller subtitle text. Changed navigation links from Spanish to English: "Our Service, Projects, Work, Our Team, Our Feed, Contact". Replaced Spanish contact info with Vulturelines contact details: Chennai address, +91 9791670504 phone, sutheesh.s@vulturelines.com email. Replaced SVG "H" logo with Vulturelines logo image. Changed background from purple-black to dark green and heading color from orange to black.
Decisions: Converted to static footer; dark green theme provides strong contrast; black heading provides emphasis; responsive grid layout for navigation sections.
Next steps: Test responsive behavior on mobile; verify all links work; adjust colors/spacing if needed.

Code changes: 
- Enhanced HTML meta tags in `index.html`: added viewport scaling, theme-color, Apple mobile web app tags, MS tile color, IE compatibility tag for better cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- Added responsive styles for `.hero-content-bottom` across all breakpoints (768px, 576px, 420px) in `src/styles/main.css` - converts from absolute to relative positioning on mobile with proper padding and font scaling.
- Improved mobile hero layout: hero-three uses flexbox with order property on mobile (content-bottom order:1, sidebar order:2, actions order:3) to ensure proper stacking.
- Added cross-browser vendor prefixes: -webkit- and -ms- prefixes for flexbox, animations, transforms to support older browsers (Safari, IE11, Edge).
- Enhanced touch interactions: added -webkit-tap-highlight-color, touch-action: manipulation, min-height/width for touch targets (44px minimum) in mobile media queries.
- Prevented horizontal overflow: added overflow-x: hidden to html and body to prevent horizontal scrolling issues.
- Added hardware acceleration hints: backface-visibility: hidden, transform: translateZ(0), will-change properties for smoother animations across all browsers.
- Fixed text overflow: added overflow: hidden, text-overflow: ellipsis to project-name to prevent layout breaks on mobile.
- Enhanced animation compatibility: added -webkit-keyframes alongside standard @keyframes for slideRightToLeft animation.

Topics: Our Service rotating carousel - full structure view on mobile responsive
Code changes: 
- In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, added mobile detection using `isMobile` and `isSmallMobile` states with resize listener. Updated carousel to use responsive values: radius reduced to 220px on small mobile (≤480px), 280px on mobile (≤768px), 540px on desktop; perspective adjusted to 1500/1800/3500 respectively; container width set to 100vw on mobile, height set to auto; card sizes reduced progressively (small mobile: 160-240px width, 220-320px height; mobile: 200-280px width, 280-390px height; desktop: 280-410px width, 390-540px height); added responsive margin calculations.
- In `src/styles/main.css`, enhanced mobile-specific CSS rules for `.service-carousel-3d` class and carousel wrapper divs: added overflow: visible, full viewport width (100vw), margin: 0, left/right: 0 positioning; updated selector to target `div[style*="perspective"]` to catch dynamic perspective values; added `.our-service-page` class rules to ensure page container allows overflow on mobile (768px and 480px breakpoints).
Decisions: Progressive radius reduction (220px/280px/540px) ensures all cards visible across all mobile screen sizes; adjusted perspective and container dimensions provide full structure view without clipping; overflow visible on page and carousel containers ensures cards extending beyond viewport are shown; smaller card sizes on very small screens maintain visibility.
Next steps: Test on actual mobile devices; verify all cards remain visible during rotation across all screen sizes; verify horizontal scrolling doesn't occur unintentionally.

Topics: Our Service carousel cards - square shape on mobile responsive
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, updated carousel card dimensions to be square on mobile devices: height now matches width for both small mobile (≤480px) and mobile (≤768px) breakpoints. Changed height values from different clamp ranges to match width values: small mobile height changed from `clamp(220px, 48vw, 320px)` to `clamp(160px, 35vw, 240px)`; mobile height changed from `clamp(280px, 52vw, 390px)` to `clamp(200px, 38vw, 280px)`. Updated marginTop calculations to use same values as marginLeft for proper centering. Desktop cards remain rectangular with original proportions.
Decisions: Square cards on mobile provide better visual consistency and fit mobile screens more effectively; maintains aspect ratio that works well for touch interactions.
Next steps: Test carousel rotation with square cards on mobile; verify cards remain visible and properly centered during rotation.

Topics: Our Service header to carousel spacing - reduce gap on mobile responsive
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, reduced spacing between header section and carousel cards on mobile: changed paddingBottom of header div from `3em` to `1em` on mobile, and reduced tagline bottom margin from `2.5em` to `1em` on mobile. Desktop spacing remains unchanged (paddingBottom: `2em`, tagline margin: `0.4em 0 2.5em`).
Decisions: Decreased spacing creates tighter layout on mobile while maintaining adequate separation; reduces excessive white space between header and carousel for better visual flow.
Next steps: Verify spacing looks balanced on mobile devices; fine-tune if needed.

Topics: Mobile responsive - board of directors images show before animations process
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx`, added mobile detection state (`isMobile`) and section visibility tracking (`isSectionInView`). Updated board members slider to hide images initially on mobile (opacity: 0) and only show them when section is in view AND scroll progress > 0 (animation has started). Added smooth fade-in transition for opacity on mobile. In `src/styles/main.css`, set initial opacity to 0 for `.board-members-slider` on mobile breakpoints (≤768px and ≤480px) with transition properties for smooth fade-in.
Decisions: Images hidden initially on mobile to prevent showing before animations; fade-in only triggers when scroll animation begins processing; desktop behavior unchanged.
Next steps: Test on actual mobile devices; verify images fade in smoothly when scrolling to board section; adjust timing if needed.

Topics: Board of directors section - first image stuck, then scroll image by image
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx`, modified scroll progress calculation to implement sticky first image behavior. Added `stickyThreshold` of 0.2 (20% of scroll) where first image stays centered (translateX = 0). After threshold, scroll progress maps to card indices (0 to totalCards-1) for image-by-image scrolling. Added `sliderRef` and `cardWidth` state to measure actual card width dynamically (including gap). Changed transform from percentage-based to pixel-based translation (`translateX(-${scrollProgress * cardWidth}px)`) for precise image-by-image scrolling. Card width measurement happens on mount, resize, and first scroll to ensure accuracy across breakpoints.
Decisions: First image remains stuck/centered when section first enters viewport; after 20% scroll threshold, images scroll one by one progressively; pixel-based translation ensures accurate positioning; dynamic card width measurement adapts to screen size changes.
Next steps: Test on different screen sizes; verify first image stays centered initially; confirm smooth image-by-image progression after threshold.

Topics: Excellence section - text quietly increases size on scroll
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, added `excellenceRef` and `excellenceScrollProgress` state to track scroll progress through excellence section. Added scroll listener that calculates progress from 0 to 1 as section moves through viewport. Applied scroll-based size increase to subtitle (15% max increase), description (12% max increase), and buttons (8% scale increase) using inline styles with smooth transitions. Size increases gradually and quietly as user scrolls through the section.
Decisions: Subtle, gradual size increase creates quiet growth effect; different increase percentages for different elements (subtitle 15%, description 12%, buttons 8%) for visual hierarchy; smooth transitions ensure non-jarring animation.
Next steps: Test scroll behavior; verify size increases feel natural and not too aggressive; adjust percentages if needed.
