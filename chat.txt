Topics: Home services overlay one-by-one slide-up on scroll; observer lifecycle fix
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, split scroll listener and IntersectionObserver logic into two effects. Added `lastScrollRef` to avoid re-attaching listeners on scroll. Observers for service 2/3/4 now initialize once and clean up on unmount; emblem observer unchanged in behavior but moved to the one-time effect. No CSS/markup changes.
Decisions: Minimal, targeted fix; keep existing thresholds and trigger markers; preserve current animation classes in CSS.
Next steps: Visually verify scroll down/up behavior across breakpoints; optionally add small stagger delay if desired.

Topics: Black section with fixed center and rotating image rings
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx`, added a new black section featuring a completely stationary blank center and three concentric rotating rings (8/10/12 items) using CSS `rotateY` keyframes and `translateZ(radius)` for even circular distribution.
Decisions: Kept animation scoped and CSS-driven for smooth performance; center remains static; rings pause on hover.
Next steps: Tune radii/speeds if desired; replace placeholder images with production assets.

Topics: Scroll-driven rotation for circular carousel
Code changes: Updated the black carousel section in `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx` to rotate rings based on page scroll. Removed autoplay `animation` on rings, added refs and a `requestAnimationFrame` loop that maps scroll progress to ring `rotateY` transforms (inner 360°, middle -270°, outer 180°). Center remains static.
Decisions: Minimal, page-scoped change; smooth performance using rAF and passive scroll.
Next steps: Adjust rotation multipliers if you want faster/slower scroll coupling.

Topics: Home Capabilities section redesign - three-column layout with parallax effects
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, restructured Capabilities section from 2-column to 3-column grid (image left, moving text center, accordion right). Added parallax scroll effects: left image zooms in only (scale 1 to 1.2) without translation using only scale transform, center text scrolls vertically (300px down) and fades (opacity 1 to 0.2) as it exits, right accordion list remains static. Implemented scroll-based transform calculations using `capabilitiesRef`, scroll progress detection, and state management for imageScale, textTransform, and textOpacity. Fixed text animation to use `translateY` instead of `translateX` for correct vertical movement. Reduced main heading font size from 48px to 36px. Updated parallax logic to trigger only when section is fully in viewport (section top < 0 && bottom > 0), with progress calculated as absolute top / height. Moved descriptive text below image outside animated wrapper so it remains static.
Decisions: Page-scoped parallax logic; 3 equal columns with 64px gaps; image and text move at different speeds based on scroll progress through section (minHeight 90vh, section padding 100px).
Next steps: Verify parallax smoothness and responsiveness across breakpoints; test accordion interactions with new layout.

Topics: Contact section text fill-back animation with floating 3D icons
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, replaced Contact section with new layout featuring large promotional text and floating 3D app icons (Photoshop, ChatGPT, monkey icon, S logo). Added text fill-back animation where text transitions from gray (#999) to black (#000) letter-by-letter across all rows based on scroll progress. Implemented scroll-based animation using `contactRef`, linear progress calculation (scrolled / scrollDistance where scrollDistance = viewport height + section height), and `textFillProgress` state. Created `renderAnimatedText()` helper function that combines all text lines into single string, calculates filledLetters count based on global progress, maps over textLines to render each letter with globalIndex calculation, and renders conditional `<br />` between lines. Icons positioned absolutely with perspective 3D transforms and semi-transparent styling. Letter-by-letter animation across all rows provides progressive reveal effect.
Decisions: Animation triggers when section is in viewport; text fills progressively from left to right, top to bottom as section scrolls through viewport; floating icons provide visual interest without distraction.
Next steps: Verify animation smoothness; adjust thresholds if needed; test responsiveness across breakpoints.

Topics: Footer section redesign - dark theme with logo, navigation, and social links
Code changes: In `src/components/FlowAnimation.jsx`, completely redesigned footer section to match provided image. Removed scroll animation logic. Added dark green background (#0a2a1a). Created three-column layout: left side with Vulturelines logo (Vlt_logo1.png) and tagline "Vulturelines" in black (#000) with subtitle "With strategic design and Webflow development." in white, right side with EXPLORA navigation column and CONTACT info column. Bottom section includes social media icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) with hover effects, copyright text, and legal links. All styling done inline with hover states for interactive elements. Updated tagline to "Vulturelines" with smaller subtitle text. Changed navigation links from Spanish to English: "Our Service, Projects, Work, Our Team, Our Feed, Contact". Replaced Spanish contact info with Vulturelines contact details: Chennai address, +91 9791670504 phone, sutheesh.s@vulturelines.com email. Replaced SVG "H" logo with Vulturelines logo image. Changed background from purple-black to dark green and heading color from orange to black.
Decisions: Converted to static footer; dark green theme provides strong contrast; black heading provides emphasis; responsive grid layout for navigation sections.
Next steps: Test responsive behavior on mobile; verify all links work; adjust colors/spacing if needed.

Topics: Hide MinimalistNav when FlowAnimation footer is in view
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, added `flowAnimationRef` and `showNav` state. Wrapped FlowAnimation component in div with ref. Added useEffect to detect when FlowAnimation footer enters viewport (when rect.top < window.innerHeight) and hide MinimalistNav by setting showNav to false. Conditionally rendered MinimalistNav based on showNav state using {showNav && <MinimalistNav />}.
Decisions: Navigation hidden when footer visible for cleaner footer presentation; nav automatically shows/hides based on scroll position.
Next steps: Test behavior on scroll; verify nav doesn't interfere with footer content.

Topics: Comprehensive cross-platform and mobile responsiveness improvements
Code changes: 
- Enhanced HTML meta tags in `index.html`: added viewport scaling, theme-color, Apple mobile web app tags, MS tile color, IE compatibility tag for better cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- Added responsive styles for `.hero-content-bottom` across all breakpoints (768px, 576px, 420px) in `src/styles/main.css` - converts from absolute to relative positioning on mobile with proper padding and font scaling.
- Improved mobile hero layout: hero-three uses flexbox with order property on mobile (content-bottom order:1, sidebar order:2, actions order:3) to ensure proper stacking.
- Added cross-browser vendor prefixes: -webkit- and -ms- prefixes for flexbox, animations, transforms to support older browsers (Safari, IE11, Edge).
- Enhanced touch interactions: added -webkit-tap-highlight-color, touch-action: manipulation, min-height/width for touch targets (44px minimum) in mobile media queries.
- Prevented horizontal overflow: added overflow-x: hidden to html and body to prevent horizontal scrolling issues.
- Added hardware acceleration hints: backface-visibility: hidden, transform: translateZ(0), will-change properties for smoother animations across all browsers.
- Fixed text overflow: added overflow: hidden, text-overflow: ellipsis to project-name to prevent layout breaks on mobile.
- Enhanced animation compatibility: added -webkit-keyframes alongside standard @keyframes for slideRightToLeft animation.
Decisions: Comprehensive approach ensures compatibility across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Mobile-first responsive design with touch-friendly interactions. Vendor prefixes added for maximum browser compatibility.
Next steps: Test on actual devices across platforms; verify animations perform smoothly; check for any remaining layout issues on specific screen sizes.
