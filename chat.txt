Topics: Capabilities section layout update; conversation log setup
Code changes: Updated `src/pages/Home.jsx` to make Capabilities left column sticky (position: sticky; top: 0) replacing previous translate-based animation.
Decisions: Keep inline styles (minimal edits), keep id="feed" and current content; apply stickiness across all breakpoints.
Next steps: Verify responsive behavior; optionally move sticky rule to CSS class if reuse is desired.

Topics: Home services overlay one-by-one slide-up on scroll; observer lifecycle fix
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, split scroll listener and IntersectionObserver logic into two effects. Added `lastScrollRef` to avoid re-attaching listeners on scroll. Observers for service 2/3/4 now initialize once and clean up on unmount; emblem observer unchanged in behavior but moved to the one-time effect. No CSS/markup changes.
Decisions: Minimal, targeted fix; keep existing thresholds and trigger markers; preserve current animation classes in CSS.
Next steps: Visually verify scroll down/up behavior across breakpoints; optionally add small stagger delay if desired.

Topics: Our Service page background color update
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, changed top-level wrapper background from `#f8f9fa` to `#ffffff` to make the page background white.
Decisions: Minimal, page-scoped inline style change to avoid affecting other routes.
Next steps: Verify text and card contrast on white; adjust any section-specific backgrounds if needed.

Topics: Our Feed carousel removal request
Code changes: Removed circular carousel section and associated scroll animation refs from `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx`.
Decisions: Preserve 3D gallery and highlights sections without replacements for carousel.
Next steps: Review Our Feed layout for spacing gaps and confirm no lingering carousel styles.

Topics: Our Service page custom header (logo + menu)
Code changes: 
- `src/components/Header.jsx`: added `logoSrc` and `menuItems` props with safe defaults; menu renders `Link` or anchor based on href.
- `src/pages/OurService.jsx`: replaced `MinimalistNav` with `Header`, passing `logoSrc` `/assets/Images/Vlt_logo1.png` and a page-specific menu.
Decisions: Keep change scoped to Our Service; maintain defaults for other pages; no global CSS edits.
Next steps: Confirm chosen logo and menu match branding; adjust items/links if needed.

Topics: Header circle button color update
Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, updated `.nav-circle-btn` to dark blue background/border (`#0d47a1`), hover to `#0b3d91`, and kept `.circle-v` text white on hover.
Decisions: Global style to match requested dark blue for the V menu circle; maintains contrast and hover feedback.
Next steps: Verify on all pages that header contrast remains accessible on light/dark backgrounds.

Topics: Our Service page content section under 3D cards
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, added a responsive two-column section below the carousel (image left, title/metadata/description/link right) using inline styles and placeholder content.
Decisions: Keep changes scoped with inline styles; dynamic image via Unsplash; easy to duplicate for more entries.
Next steps: Replace placeholder text/link with real project details or map over data for multiple blocks.

Time: N/A
Topics: Zigzag projects + scroll zoom animation
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, added `PROJECTS` array and mapped 4 zigzag sections (alternating layout). Implemented scroll-based zoom for project images using a page-scoped scroll handler that scales between 0.96–1.04, with `data-zoom` and inline `transition`.
Decisions: Page-scoped JS (no global CSS); minimal DOM queries; passive scroll handler.
Next steps: Fine-tune scale range/timing if you want a stronger/weaker effect.

Topics: Build error fix in OurService.jsx
Code changes: Removed TypeScript-style casts in cleanup (`onScroll as any`) and used standard `removeEventListener` signatures.
Decisions: Keep file as plain JS/JSX; no TS syntax.
Next steps: Verify no further parser errors; adjust animation if needed.

Topics: New OurFeed page (3D collage)
Code changes: Created `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx` with fullscreen black background, perspective 3D scattered images, gentle auto-rotation with mouse parallax, and bottom tabs (VIBES/HIGHLIGHTS/ARTICLES). Added route `/our-feed` in `src/App.jsx`.
Decisions: Page uses inline styles and Unsplash placeholders; header unchanged.
Next steps: Optionally point header "Our Feed" menu to `/our-feed` and replace images/content as desired.

Topics: Update menu to navigate to Our Feed page
Code changes: Updated `src/components/Header.jsx` default menu and `src/components/MinimalistNav.jsx` to link "Our Feed" to `/our-feed`.
Decisions: Ensure consistent navigation across header variants; no other behavior changed.
Next steps: Verify navigation from all pages; adjust menu ordering if needed.

Topics: Our Feed top header layout (FEED + tagline) added
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx`, added a white top section with left-aligned `FEED` title and right-aligned tagline “LESS NOISE ✦ MORE SUBSTANCE”. Wrapped the 3D collage in a black section with a top row showing `VIBES` on the left and an explanatory sentence on the right.
Decisions: Page-scoped inline styles; preserved existing 3D scene and tabs.
Next steps: Tweak font sizes/spacing to exactly match desired look if needed.

Time: N/A
Topics: Adjust FEED header spacing
Code changes: Increased top padding of Our Feed header section from 48px to 72px in `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx` to move “FEED / LESS NOISE ✦ MORE SUBSTANCE” slightly down.
Decisions: Minimal, page-scoped tweak.
Next steps: Fine-tune spacing if you want more/less offset.

Topics: Our Feed page header logo/menu like Our Service
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx`, rendered `Header` with `logoSrc` `/assets/Images/Vlt_logo1.png` and page menu (Home, Our Service, Projects, Our Feed, Contact).
Decisions: Page-scoped header added to match Our Service styling.
Next steps: If duplicate headers appear due to global header in `App.jsx`, we can remove the global header and render per-page instead.

Topics: Our Feed Highlights section cleanup
Code changes: Removed the chip/tag row under the second highlight card in `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx` that displayed “VIBES, HIGHLIGHTS, ARTICLES”.
Decisions: Minimal and targeted removal; no other layout/content changes.
Next steps: Confirm visual spacing looks good without the chips; adjust padding if desired.

Time: N/A
Topics: Black section with fixed center and rotating image rings
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx`, added a new black section featuring a completely stationary blank center and three concentric rotating rings (8/10/12 items) using CSS `rotateY` keyframes and `translateZ(radius)` for even circular distribution.
Decisions: Kept animation scoped and CSS-driven for smooth performance; center remains static; rings pause on hover.
Next steps: Tune radii/speeds if desired; replace placeholder images with production assets.

Time: N/A
Topics: Scroll-driven rotation for circular carousel
Code changes: Updated the black carousel section in `src/pages/OurFeed.jsx` to rotate rings based on page scroll. Removed autoplay `animation` on rings, added refs and a `requestAnimationFrame` loop that maps scroll progress to ring `rotateY` transforms (inner 360°, middle -270°, outer 180°). Center remains static.
Decisions: Minimal, page-scoped change; smooth performance using rAF and passive scroll.
Next steps: Adjust rotation multipliers if you want faster/slower scroll coupling.

Time: N/A
Topics: Our Service carousel spacing tweak
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, reduced 3D carousel radius from 600 to 540 to slightly decrease gaps between rotating cards.
Decisions: Keep all other carousel params unchanged for consistent animation behavior.
Next steps: Visually confirm spacing across breakpoints; adjust radius further if needed.
